# Sega Master System Divide By Three Jailbar Fix

1 - Kill the divide-by-three clock divider in the VDP that creates the CPU clock.

The VDP divide-by-three circuit is known to cause jailbars in the analog video signals.

2 - Create a separate clock divider external to the VDP to recreate the CPU clock.

This will keep the CPU clock in sync with the VDP clock.

I am struggling to make a successful clock divider circuit using discrete components. My plan is to reach out for some help in finishing this project.

Will populate this repository soon.

Cheers
